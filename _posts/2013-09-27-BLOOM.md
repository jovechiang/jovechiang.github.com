In my current work, I want to speed up the text pattern match and have good cache behavior. For pattern match, there are several pretty good algorithm : _KMP_ , _Rabin Karp_.I found the following algorithm is extremely awesome!!!! This algorithm quickly filter out non-related corpus. It reduces quite a lot in terms of problem size.
